Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering involves systematic approach to various life aspects, using engineering principles, methods, and tools to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain high quality software systems.
Software engineering enables creation of software programs or systems that conform to various aspects of modern life for example operating systems like windows used in people's computers.
Software engineering ensures creation of reliable, secure and innovative software solutions to real life problems, for example booking a flight via an online application without having to first travel to the airport and back.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i) Development of programming languages in 1950s and 1960s, such as Fortan in 1957, COBOL in 1959, then C in 1972. these high level programming languages made it possible for programmers to write more complex and abstract code more easily than it was with machine or assembly languages.
ii) Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s, with the 1968 NATO conference on software engineering, making the concept formal with establishment of structured approaches, design principles and process methodologies, meant to address the software crisis where large software projects were often delivered late, over budget, even with multiple defects.
iii) Introduction of agile methodologies in 2000s, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, which focused on iterative development, continuous feedback, and adptability, thus promoting customer involvement, flexibility and collaborating, leading to faster delivery of software and better alignment with user needs as opposed to the previously linear and rigid sequence of phases.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i) Requiremenet gathering and documentation, involves taking note of user specific needs to be accomplished by the requied software system.
ii) Design, involves generating visual representations of the expecteed architecture and components of the system in form of wireframes, mockups and prototype.
iii) Implementation, involves putting the design in to real code in development environment, to generate the intended functions inferred by the designs. Here security elements can be instilled with respect to the principles of best practice.
iv) Testing, involves running the finished software in a controlled environment while monitoring its perfomance, a process meant to validate the system funtionality and catch any bugs or issues before fowarding it to the production environment.
v) Deployment, involves lauching the refined version of the software in to production environment as intended by th project ojectives, to operate towards achieving user goals.
vi) Maintenance, involves continuous monitoring and making necessary adjustment to the running software system, by making updates to fix bugs or add features, meant to improve performance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and agile denote well renown approaches to the software development cycle, with both focusing on managing the process effectively to completion with specified user needs well met.
They are both structured in phases from planning to achievement of user needs, with sufficient documentation of the whole process and geared to delivering a functional software that meets user needs.
However, the execution and order of events varies between the two approaches differ in that;
Waterfall approach is linear and sequential, with each phase having to be complete before moving to the next, whereas agile involves an iterative approach where each stage of the project is divided in to small manageable sprints that are continuously improved based on the reesults and feedback untill the desired are achieved.
Waterfall is generally suited for projects with clear, stable and fully defined scope whereas agile deals with projects having dynamic requirements, involving frequent feedback based adjustments and continuous improvements towards the required needs.
The scenario for waterfall approach would include developing a simple traffic control lighting system with a clear predefined order in which the system is supposed to direct vehicles in the roads, such that the process can flow through the phases to completion without need for returning to the previous stages;
whereas the agile approach would apply to projects like developing a mobile applications for a start up company with no complete preview of their total needs, such that the process would involve multiple introduction of new needs that have to be integrated in to the system from design to deployment.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer, writes, and maintains the code, ensuring that it meets the funtional requirements of the user.
Quality Assurance Engineer, designs test cases, execute tests and identify defects the software to ensure that it meets quality standards before release

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a suite of features like code editors, compilers, debuggers, and project management tools, that streamline software development.For example Visual Studio Code which is lightweight, highly customizable IDE with extensive support for plugins.
VCS manage changes to code across teams as they allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase, track changes, and manage different versions of the software.For examples Git whic is a distributed version control system widely used in both open-source and enterprise projects.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, during the development cycle which keeps rolling the process back to previous phases, causing significant delays in completion.
Tight deadlines, which impose pressure to the team leading to rush approaches, which compromise the overall quality
Technical debt, can also occur following use of suboptimal methods, resorted to by the team due to several reasons, which later leads to maintenance overheads.
Software engineers try to overcome these challenges by;
-fostering effective communication within the team and external entities

- use of flexible approaches like agile method, which allows for continuous changes during the development cylce
  -proper organization of tasks according to priority, in order to allocate time and resources more effectively
  -Regular assessment of project goals and timelines, to ensure proper adjustments necessary to deliver the project on time

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing, involves testing individual components or functions in isolation to ensure they work as expected.This is meant to catch bugs early in the development process, ensuring that each unit performs its specific function correctly.
Integration testing, involves testing the interaction between integrated units or modules to ensure they work together as expected. This identifies issues that may arise when different components interact, such as data mismatches or communication errors.
System testing, involves testing the entire system as a whole, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements.It validates the overall behavior and functionality of the software, ensuring that all components work together as may be required in the intended environment.
Acceptance testing, involves testing the software against the requirements and criteria agreed upon by the stakeholders to determine if itâ€™s ready for release.This ensures that the software meets business requirements and customer expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or statements such that they can result in best possible responses from and AI model.
It is important in that ;

- it ensures complete and clear answers for the AI model user
- Minimizes hallucinations from the AI model, thus focussing on only asked for answers
- Prevents confusion that can be created by some AI model responses
- Saves time by getting faster appropraite solutions for user qerries
  Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  A vague prompt would be like "How is beans cooked?", and the improved version would be "give a step by step process for cooking beans", the later version would bring out a more clear sequential answer to the question of how beans is prepared as opposed to the former prompt which would leave the AI model to decide how best it would present the answer.
